\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conc}
In this deliverable, we have described and analyzed all the internal datasets provided by
the FashionBrain partners. This dataset description will help to identify the datasets needed for each task in the project as well as the connections between the provided datasets.  In addition to the dataset description, we have also performed a survey on \ac{CF} to evaluate the importance of \ac{SM} platforms in online shopping. One of the main results of this survey shows that more than 44\% of the social network users frequently purchase items discovered through \ac{SM}, which confirms the increasing importance of \ac{SM} in the fashion industry. The results of this survey will help us identifying
the social platform to focus on for the task of identifying fashion trends using social media (related to D5.5).
