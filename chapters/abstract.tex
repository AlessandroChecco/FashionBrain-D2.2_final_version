In the context of the FashionBrain project, several datasets have been provided by our partners which
will be used in order to perform different tasks such as extract key features from text and/or images, capture customersâ€™ preferences or predict new fashion trends as they emerge on social media and the blogosphere.  In this deliverable,
we describe these datasets (size, format, properties, etc.) and we explain how  to identify and expand the sources of data relevant to the domain of fashion by means of crowdsourcing. We conducted a survey in order to assess the importance of social media in the online shopping experience. As a result, we are able to extract the most important social media platforms as well as the most important features in online shopping.
